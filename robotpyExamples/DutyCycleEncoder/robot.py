        # and you should measure this value. You can do so with either
        # an oscilloscope, or by observing the "Frequency" output
        # on the dashboard while running this sample. If you find
        # the value jumping between the 2 values, enter halfway between
        # those values. This number doesn't have to be perfect,

        # The sensor will assume its now at the furthest away position,
        # which control algorithms might not handle correctly. Therefore
        # it can be a good idea to slightly shift the output so the sensor
        # can go a bit negative before wrapping. Usually 10% or so is fine.
