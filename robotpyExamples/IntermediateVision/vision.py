# This is a demo program showing the use of OpenCV to do vision processing. The image is acquired
# from the USB camera, then a rectangle is put on the image and sent to the dashboard. OpenCV has
# many methods for different types of processing.
#
# NOTE: This code runs in its own process, so we cannot access the robot here,
#       nor can we create/use/see wpilib objects
#
# To try this code out locally (if you have robotpy-cscore installed), you
# can execute `python3 -m cscore vision.py:main`
#

import cv2
import numpy as np

from cscore import CameraServer as CS


def main():
    CS.enableLogging()

    # Get the UsbCamera from CameraServer
    camera = CS.startAutomaticCapture()
    # Set the resolution
    camera.setResolution(640, 480)

    # Get a CvSink. This will capture images from the camera
    cvSink = CS.getVideo()
    # Setup a CvSource. This will send images back to the Dashboard
    outputStream = CS.putVideo("Rectangle", 640, 480)

    # Allocating new images is very expensive, always try to preallocate
    mat = np.zeros(shape=(480, 640, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

    while True:
        # Tell the CvSink to grab a frame from the camera and put it
        # in the source image.  If there is an error notify the output.
        time, mat = cvSink.grabFrame(mat)
        if time == 0:
            # Send the output the error.
            outputStream.notifyError(cvSink.getError())
            # skip the rest of the current iteration
            continue

        # Put a rectangle on the image
        cv2.rectangle(mat, (100, 100), (400, 400), (255, 255, 255), 5)

        # Give the output stream a new image to display
        outputStream.putFrame(mat)
