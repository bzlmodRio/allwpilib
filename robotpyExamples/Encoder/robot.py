    Sample program displaying the value of a quadrature encoder on the SmartDashboard. Quadrature
    Encoders are digital sensors which can detect the amount the encoder has rotated since starting
    as well as the direction in which the encoder shaft is rotating. However, encoders can not tell
    you the absolute position of the encoder shaft (ie, it considers where it starts to be the zero
    position, no matter where it starts), and so can only tell you how much the encoder has rotated
    since starting. Depending on the precision of an encoder, it will have fewer or greater ticks per
    revolution; the number of ticks per revolution will affect the conversion between ticks and
    distance, as specified by DistancePerPulse. One of the most common uses of encoders is in the
    drivetrain, so that the distance that the robot drives can be precisely controlled during the
    autonomous mode.
